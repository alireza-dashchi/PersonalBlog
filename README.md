# Personal Blog

This project is a simple blog, which is created with Django.

## Description

This personal blog is a website where I can record my thought or experiences or talks about a subject. It has an admin panel so I can share my story in a post, upload an image with that and select some tags like Hot, New, and so on for this post. The homepage has some sections: My photo, About Me, All Posts, and My Latest Thought. You can access all posts by clicking on the All Posts part. Moreover, My Latest Taught shows the three latest posts with their summary. By clicking on each post, you can read the post. Below each post, people can submit their comments about the post or read other person's comments. Comments have validation on the fields and invalid data will not be stored in the database.
